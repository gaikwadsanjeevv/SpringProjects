## Spring  
Spring Boot is a framework for building applicagtions in the java programming langauge
It makes easy to create stand-alone, production-grade applications using java.  
A standalone application is a self-contained application that can run independently without requiring additional dependencies or external setup you can package the entire application code, libraries and embedded server into a fat jar or Uber jar which can run through the command:   
Java - jar my app.jar  
A production grade application is the one that is ready to be deployed into a production environment with features that ensures reliability security scalability and observability.  
The core spring framework already reduces boilerplate code and provides of helpful features for Java application.  
However spring boot takes this convenience to the next level by focusing specifically on reducing the effort required to set up and configure a spring application. When spring does simplify many tasks like creating web applications, working databases, managing transactions and many more. Still there where many manual configurations need to be done and hence spring boot came, where we can add autoconfiguration to make Standalone applications.

Annotations in Java are a form of metadata that provide information about the program but do not affect the program's execution directly. Annotations are used to mark or decorate elements such as classes, methods, fields, parameters, and other program components.  

Annotations help tools, compilers, and frameworks process code, generate code, or perform specific actions.  
Purpose:  
Provide instructions to the compiler (e.g., @Override).  
Enable runtime processing (e.g., @Deprecated, @SuppressWarnings).  
Allow frameworks (like Spring) to process metadata to perform dependency injection, etc.  
Placement: Annotations can be applied to classes, methods, fields, variables, parameters, and packages.
